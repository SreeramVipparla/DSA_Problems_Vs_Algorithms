# Task-1
Square_root_of_an_integer.py-
 
Inthis code to solve the issue of solving the square root of an integer i have used a binary search algorithm.I also made sure to limit my code according to the constraints given.

Time complexity-
Since the code is dominated by the binary search algorithm the time complexity of the code is O(log(n)).

Space complexity-
In the code since the scape complexity does not depend on the input given.
Therefore the space complexity of the code is O(1).

# Task-2
Search_in_a_rotated sort_Array.py-

In this code for solving issue i have used a binary search algorithm.
But here since it is a rotated array search i have divided the array into two parts and check them each time.

Time complexity-
In this code since the  running time grows in proportion to the logarithm of the input size 
the time complexity of the code is O(logn).

Spcae complexity-
In the code since the scape complexity does not depend on the input given.
Therefore the space complexity of the code is O(1).

# Task-3
Rearrange_Array_Digits.py-

In this code for solving the problem i have ordered the components and sorted them
 to create a numbert dependent on a sequence of sum of the higher digits.

Time complexity-
Here in the code the  data set is repeatedly divided into half and each half is processed again independently.
due to this the time complexity of the code is O(n log n).

Space complexity-
Here in the code the space complexity of the code is O(n) asfor each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated.

# Task-4
Dutch_National_Flag.py
In this code the the goal is to keep a count of number of 0s, 1s and 2s in the given array.The  Output list will contain the appropriate number of 0s, 1s and 2s Since the code runs through the list only once.
To solve this issue I have made the program  traverse the array to sort it.
Time complexity-
In this code since the functions  increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs the time complexity of the code is O(n).

Space complexity-
In the code for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated.
Due to this the space complexity of the code is O(n).

# Task-5
Trie.py-
In this code to solve the issue i have implemented a trie datastructure that returns all the words related  in a list to the  input prefix.

Time complexity-
Here in the code the worst case senario is when we have to go through each node.Due to this the time complexity of the code is O(n)[n is the number of nodes]
complexities of vital methods-
1)Insert->The time complexity of this method is O(n)[n is the length of the  given word].

The space complexity of the method is O(n)[n is the number of nodes] because the trie space initially grows linearly with the number of words but later gradually decrease due to overlapping words.

2)Generate_suffix->The time complexity of this method is O(n)[n is the number of trie nodes].

The space complexity of Generate_suffix is O(n) [n is the number of trie nodes] because it performs a linear operation is case of a dictionary containing similar prefixes to the word given.

3)Find->The time complexity of this method is O(n)[n is the length of the string]

Space complexity-
In the code for each input element there may be up to a fixed number of k bytes allocated.
Due to this the space complexity of the code is O(n).


# Task-6
Unsorted_integer_array.py-
In this code to find out the smallest and largest integer from a list of unsorted integers i  have used a linear search algorith to cross check
and verify and update the findings accordingly.

Time complexity-
In this code since the functions  increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs the time complexity of the code is O(n).

Space complexity-
In the following code the space complexity of the code is O(1) as the function does ot depend on the size of the input,due to this it takes constant time.

# Task-7
Http_router.py-
in this code to solve the issue i have created a working dictionary with an efficient trie datastructure similar to that of Task5(Trie.py).
The time complexities of some vital methods for insreting,searching,deleting from the trie depend on the length of the word.Due to this the time complexity of these vital ethods isw O(an)

Time complexity-
Here in the code since each element can be indirectly accessed the complexity is linear with a time complexity of O(mn)

Space complexity-
In this code since the functions  increase linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs the time complexity of the code is O(n).
